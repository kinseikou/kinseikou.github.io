      <description>My first blog. This is the first blog I published on my personal site.
I mainly share my thoughts on blogs and exchange technology.
From now on, I will record my thoughts and bring help and good feelings to everyone.
How is this site made? My personal site was created by Github&amp;rsquo;s personal static page hosting service and Hugo, a static page building tool.
